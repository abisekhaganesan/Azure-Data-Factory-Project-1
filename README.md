# Simplifying Data Processing in Azure Cloud with Data Factory and SQL

In this repo, I've documented one of the real world 'AZURE Data Engneering' example on how to use Azure Data Factory to extract data from various online storage systems (Here I've used Git repo) and store it in Azure Data Lake Gen 2. Once the data is extracted from the source and stored in Data Lake, we will use Azure SQL to store and process the data.

# Required Resource 
1. Azure Subscription
2. Azure Data Factory
3. Storage Account - Data Lake Gen 2
4. Azure SQL Database

# Achitecture of the Example
